.. _api/db/compact:

``/db/_compact``
================

.. http:post:: /{db}/_compact

  Request compaction of the specified database. Compaction compresses the
  disk database file by performing the following operations:

  -  Writes a new version of the database file, removing any unused
     sections from the new version during write. Because a new file is
     temporary created for this purpose, you will need twice the current
     storage space of the specified database in order for the compaction
     routine to complete.

  -  Removes old revisions of documents from the database, up to the
     per-database limit specified by the ``_revs_limit`` database
     parameter.

  Compaction can only be requested on an individual database; you cannot
  compact all the databases for a CouchDB instance. The compaction process
  runs as a background process.

  You can determine if the compaction process is operating on a database
  by obtaining the database meta information, the ``compact_running``
  value of the returned database structure will be set to true. See
  :http:get:`/{db}`.

  You can also obtain a list of running processes to determine whether
  compaction is currently running. See :ref:`api/server/active_tasks`.
