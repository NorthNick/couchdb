.. _api/db/temp_view:

``/db/_temp_view``
==================

.. http:post:: /{db}/_temp_view

  Creates (and executes) a temporary view based on the view function
  supplied in the JSON request.

  The arguments also available to standard view requests also apply to
  temporary views, but the execution of the view may take some time as it
  relies on being executed at the time of the request. In addition to the
  time taken, they are also computationally very expensive to produce. You
  should use a defined view if you want to achieve the best performance.

  See :ref:`api/ddoc/view` for more info.
